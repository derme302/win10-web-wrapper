# Windows 10 Web Wrapper

This Visual Studio project wraps a webpage (the example in this case is the mobile website for Bendigo Bank*) in a Universal Windows Package that allows it to be deployed on any Windows 10 device (Landscape is disabled, but if enabled package would work on Xbox). Any domains in the URI field (in this case "https://*.bendigobank.com.au/") will be shown in-app, sources outside these domains will open in Edge.

*Not endorsed or affiliated with Bendigo Bank
